            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! I’m Ethan Kang, a junior at Northeastern University studying Business and Data Science with a
                    concentration in Finance. I’m originally from Toronto, Canada, and I was recruited to play for
                    Northeastern’s Men’s Varsity Soccer. On this site I share the kinds of projects that sit at the intersection
                    of sports, analytics, and design—things I naturally tinker with between classes, training, and recovery.
                    I’m drawn to problems where a clear visual can make a decision faster: a simple plot that reveals a trend,
                    a tidy dashboard that cuts through noise, or a uniform concept that balances identity with function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lately I’ve been exploring two threads. First, sports analytics: tracking how different
                    training loads and match contexts show up in performance, then translating those insights into clean
                    visuals that a coach or teammate can understand at a glance. Second, kit and brand design:
                    experimenting with palettes, type, and pattern that read well both up close and at broadcast distance.
                    My goal is the same in both worlds—reduce messy inputs into something crisp, honest, and useful.
                    If any of this resonates, feel free to click around and reach out on the contact page. I’m always open
                    to feedback, collaborations, or swapping ideas on data, design, and the game.
