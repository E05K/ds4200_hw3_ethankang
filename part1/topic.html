                This page documents how I turn a rough kit idea into a clear jersey concept. I start with a focused brief:
                what emotion should the kit carry, how should it read on broadcast, and what constraints matter for competition
                rules and sponsor placement. From there, I research the club’s past jerseys—looking at how colors, crests, and
                typography have evolved over time—to identify visual themes worth preserving. I then build a compact color
                system—usually a primary, a secondary, an accent, and a neutral—and test how those tones perform on grass under
                daylight and stadium lighting. Using Photoshop, I translate sketches into digital mockups, experimenting with
                layering techniques, gradients, and texture overlays to see how different designs come to life on fabric.

            <p>
                Once a direction feels strong, I refine it in a template to evaluate spacing tokens, stroke weights, and pattern
                repetition. I check sponsor lockups, league badges, and manufacturer marks for balance and hierarchy. Throughout
                the process, I keep referencing older kits to ensure my design feels authentic to the club’s history while still
                introducing something fresh. Finally, I export variants for home, away, and alternate kits—each related yet distinct.
                The goal is always the same: a design that honors identity, photographs well, and helps players feel fast and
                confident—something fans are proud to wear and that looks sharp on TV.
